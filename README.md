## Scikit-Learn Overview

Scikit-Learn (sklearn) is an open-source Python library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib and integrates well with these libraries. Scikit-Learn is widely used for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing.

### Key Features Demonstrated in the Notebook

1. **Linear Regression**: Predicting a continuous target variable.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification.
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classification using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Classification using support vector machines.
5. **Decision Trees**: Classification and regression using decision trees.
6. **Random Forests**: Ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees.
7. **Gradient Boosting**: Sequential ensemble technique for classification and regression.
8. **AdaBoost**: Ensemble method combining weak classifiers.
9. **K-Means Clustering**: Unsupervised clustering.
10. **DBSCAN Clustering**: Density-based clustering.
11. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique.
12. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Non-linear dimensionality reduction for visualization.
13. **Standardization**: Scaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
14. **Normalization**: Scaling data to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
15. **Label Encoding**: Converting categorical labels into numeric values.
16. **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into binary vectors.
17. **Train-Test Split**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
18. **Cross-Validation**: Evaluating model performance using k-fold cross-validation.
19. **Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exhaustively searching over a specified parameter grid.
20. **Pipeline for Workflow**: Streamlining the machine learning workflow by chaining together multiple steps.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook and explore the functionalities, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/scikit-learn-overview.git
    cd scikit-learn-overview
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
    Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Scikit-Learn Functionality.ipynb"
    ```
